# Maps

Read with `render-kit.md` when the visual is a map. Host, delivery, layout,
color, and utilities stay in `render-kit.md`. Chart and plot composition is in
`charts.md`.

## Composition

- Let the map dominate the composition. Use at most one compact
  selection/detail area and only requested controls.
- Always project published GeoJSON/TopoJSON and sourced longitude/latitude with
  `d3-geo`; never hard-code or hand-draw geographic outlines. Use schematic maps
  only when asked.
- For world countries, import
  `https://esm.sh/@d3-maps/atlas@1.0.0/world/countries/countries-110m` and convert
  it with `topojson-client@3.1.0` using
  `feature(world, world.objects.features).features`. Join input ISO3 directly to
  `feature.properties.id`, which is already ISO3; do not convert it to numbers.
- For US states or counties, use
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/us-atlas@3/counties-10m.json/+esm`. For ZIP/ZCTA
  or city boundaries, download official Census or local open-data GeoJSON; do
  not guess sibling atlas paths or import raw JSON as JavaScript.
- Keep maps geographically legible: for local points, fetch published
  neighborhood, street, or comparable geometry; a blank field or lone
  administrative outline is not a basemap. Show the full city or region behind
  points or partial choropleths, and frame the locations with modest padding.
- Include the verified geometry in the fragment so the basemap, imports,
  labels, and projected points are correct on first load.
